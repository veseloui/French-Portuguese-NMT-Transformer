# French-Portuguese-Neural-Machine-Translation-Based-on-Transformers
In this project we trained a French-Portuguese neural machine translation model. We used the French-Portuguese TED Talks dataset and a transformer architecture. After 20 training epochs validation loss and accuracy were 1.46 and 0.68, respectively.
